# Finding the Duplicate

Implementation of the following pseudo-code, utilizing it for numbers.txt, creating an alternative method, and comparing the algorithms.

### Part A: Implementation of the pseudo-code

Input: an array A of n integers

Output: the index of the element that is occurring more than once, or -1 if no such element exists

```bash
1   for i from 0 to n do
2    for j from i + 1 to n do
3      if A[i] is equal to A[j] then
4        return i
5   return ô€€€1
```

### Part B: Utilizing the created method to treat the numbers.txt

### Part C: Creating an alternative method

### Part D: Comparing the algorithms in terms of execution time.
